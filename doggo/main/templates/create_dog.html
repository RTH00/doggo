                It's technically not a dog, but you can still do a few things with it.
                It's the right choice if you are looking for something that looks like a dog (from very far away...)
                and doesn't need too much care.

                <h5 class="text-center">Corgi</h5>
                Also a very good doggo! Compact, attentive, active, this is a big dog on short legs!
                This little ball of fur will illuminate your day, but needs a good balance of affection and sport.
